# **Autonomous Drone for Cave Mapping**

**Autonomous Drone for cave mapping — A drone capable of navigating caves or tunnels automatically to map its inside environment and map them in 3D.**

This project focuses on building an autonomous aerial platform designed to explore and reconstruct underground environments such as caves, mines, and tunnels. The drone operates in fully GPS-denied conditions and generates detailed 3D maps using LiDAR, vision, and SLAM-based navigation.
